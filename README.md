# Move It

This repository is based on a [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) project course Next Level Week 4 (NLW #4) and I adapted it to my own version, if you want to see my Github profile you can access this button bellow:

The idea of the project is basically a app that uses a countdown clock to suggest some challenges for people who are using the computer or phone and when the clock gets to zero the user can pause the activity to relax a little and complete the challenges that are suggested, when these challenges are completed, you can earn some XP and get you level up as long as you complete more challenges.

## Test the app

If you want to take a look at my version of the app, here is the link for MoveIt:
